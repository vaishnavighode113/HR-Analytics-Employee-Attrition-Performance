# HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Performance

## Project Overview
Used the HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset from Kaggle to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The project focuses on identifying key factors influencing employee attrition and building predictive models to analyze employee performance and turnover patterns.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Methodology
- Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Applied Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection
- Handled class imbalance using SMOTE
- Scaled the dataset for improved model performance
- Trained multiple machine learning models

## Model Evaluation
- Compared models using Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and other evaluation metrics
- Identified the most effective model for predicting employee attrition

## Outcome
- Discovered key factors contributing to employee attrition
- Built predictive models to support data-driven HR decision-making
